# Follow Me Back

A browser extension to see who doesn't follow you back on Instagram.

It doesn't require any use of the Instagram API, so you won't get banned for automating
your account or using 3rd party apps. Everything is scraped directly from the page.

## Installation

### Firefox

Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Fyssion/followmeback/releases/latest)
and click on the xpi file.

### Chromium/Chrome

The extension has been tested on Chromium, but idk how to actually install it since I don't use Chrome.
Feel free to add instructions in a PR if you figure it out.
