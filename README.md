[![badge-chrome]][chrome]
[![badge-firefox]][firefox]

A browser extension to see who doesn't follow you back on Instagram.

It doesn't require any use of the Instagram API, so you won't get banned for automating
your account or using 3rd party apps. Everything is scraped directly from the page.

## Installation

### Firefox

Install the extension from the [Firefox Add-ons store][firefox] (recommended).

Alternatively, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/Fyssion/followmeback/releases/latest)
and click on the xpi file.
If installed this way, the extension will not be automatically updated.

### Chromium/Chrome

Install the extension from the [Chrome Web Store][chrome].

## Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect user data.
All information processing occurs strictly on-device,
and no remote connections are made.
